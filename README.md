 The Mandelbrot algorithm is implemented on the Spartan6 FPGA and outputted through a VGA port.
 
 Xilinx ISE Project Files:
 
 There are two versions of the project the first of which is in black and white and uses a
 graph area of 600x400 pixels and the second is in color and uses 300x200 pixels (reduced pixel 
 area was needed to store 3-bit colors in the dual-port RAM).
